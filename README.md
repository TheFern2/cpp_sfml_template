# cpp_sfml_template

A cross platform cmake template for sfml, with logging, and configuration.

## Using the template

The template is built for quick sfml projects, all you need is sfml installed.

I previously wrote guides for win/linux, follow sfml instructions, ignore the rest. jsoncpp, and spdlog are used as submodules on this repo:
